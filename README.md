# Task 7: Basic Sales Summary with Python, Pandas, and SQLite

## Overview

This project demonstrates a foundational data analysis workflow: connecting Python to a **SQLite database**, executing SQL queries to **aggregate data**, loading the results into a **Pandas DataFrame**, and creating a simple **bar chart** using Matplotlib.

## Objective

To pull total quantity sold and total revenue per product using SQL and display the results as a table and a visual bar chart.

## Tools and Libraries

* **Python**
* **`sqlite3`**: For database connection and running the SQL query.
* **`pandas`**: For efficient data manipulation and loading the query results.
* **`matplotlib`**: For creating the final visualization.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the foundational data pipeline of connecting Python to a database, executing SQL aggregation queries, using Pandas to process results, and generating a data visualization for clear business reporting. This workflow is essential for most real-world data analysis tasks.
